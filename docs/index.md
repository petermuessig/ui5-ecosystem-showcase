# UI5 Tooling - Ecosystem Showcase

[![OpenUI5 Community Slack (#tooling channel)](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-join-44cc11.svg)](https://join-ui5-slack.herokuapp.com)

This repository is showcasing the [UI5 Tooling](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/) extensibility capabilities. You can easily extend the UI5 Tooling with your own [tasks](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/extensibility/CustomTasks/) or [middlewares](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/extensibility/CustomServerMiddleware/).

![UI5 Tooling Ecosystem](ui5eco.jpg "UI5 Tooling Ecosystem")

This doesn't necessarily need to happen in this repository and everyone can develop and share his own tasks and middleware via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Regarding npm, please prefix the name of all tasks with `ui5-task-` and all middlewares with `ui5-middleware-`. This will help UI5 developers to easily find tasks and middlewares created and shared by the UI5 community.

## Contributing vs. Self-managed

This repository is open to anyone who wants to share his task or middleware with the UI5 community. By integrating an extension in this repository you can benefit from automated releases of the tasks and middlewares to the public npm registry. In addition, you will get a review before your task or middleware is merged. But if you prefer to manage your repository and release on your own, you can also do so. But in this case, please create a PR for this page to list your task or middleware here and share it with the UI5 community!
